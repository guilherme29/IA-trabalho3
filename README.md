# Artificial intelligence class third assignment

The description of the assignment is in the pdf file.

The first exercise is to implement a trip planner.
The second exercise is to implement a program to analyze sentences in portuguese.

I think the first exercise doesn't work properly and it's done in java.
The second exercise is done in both haskell and prolog and I think they're both working properly.
